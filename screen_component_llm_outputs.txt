The user flow "Navigate Forecast Timeframes" has been successfully processed.

**Screens Used or Created:**
- dashboard_screen

**Component Instances Used or Created:**
- forecast_timeframe_selector
- precipitation_forecast_panel

**Sub-Agent Capabilities Discovered:**
- None (all capabilities used were previously known).

**Trace Documentation:**
The user starts on the `dashboard_screen`.
1. The user taps on the `forecast_timeframe_selector` component instance. This action highlights the selected timeframe option and updates the forecast data.
2. The `precipitation_forecast_panel` component instance on the `dashboard_screen` then displays the precipitation predictions for the newly selected timeframe.

This flow reuses the existing `dashboard_screen` and introduces two new component instances: `forecast_timeframe_selector` (a new component type was created for this) and `precipitation_forecast_panel`. The usage counts for these new instances have been incremented to reflect their use in this flow.

The user flow "Select Location for Historical Weather Data" has been successfully analyzed and implemented.

Here's a summary of the actions taken:

The "Adapt Layout to Device Orientation Change" user flow has been successfully modeled by introducing a new `LayoutManager` component type and adding instances of it to all existing screens. This ensures that each screen is equipped to handle device orientation changes and adjust its layout accordingly.

**Trace for "Adapt Layout to Device Orientation Change" Flow:**

1.  **Step 1: Detect Device Orientation Change**
    *   **Action:** `device_hardware` (conceptual component representing the device's hardware capabilities) detects a `rotate_device` action.
    *   **System Response:** The system detects the orientation change.
    *   **Component Interaction:** This triggers the `LayoutManager` instance on the `current_screen`.

2.  **Step 2: Re-render UI Components and Layout**
    *   **Screen:** `current_screen` (this applies to any screen in the app).
    *   **Component:** `LayoutManager` (newly added component instance on the `current_screen`).
    *   **Action:** `view` (the `LayoutManager` re-renders the UI).
    *   **System Response:** The `LayoutManager` on the `current_screen` uses its `responsive_props` (e.g., `portrait_layout_config`, `landscape_layout_config`) to re-arrange the UI components to optimize for the new orientation.

**Summary of Changes:**

*   **Screens Used/Created:** All existing screens in the application (`dashboard_screen`, `location_management_screen`, `detailed_hourly_forecast_screen`, `daily_forecast_screen`, `daily_detail_screen`, `edit_location_screen`, `settings_screen`, `units_settings_screen`, `notification_settings_screen`, `display_settings_screen`, `radar_map_screen`, `hourly_daily_forecast_screen`, `historical_data_screen`, `date_range_picker_modal`, `trend_analysis_screen`, `parameter_selection_screen`, `detailed_weather_screen`, `alert_settings_screen`, `add_alert_location_screen`, `weather_alerts_list_screen`, `alert_history_screen`, `weather_alert_detail_screen`, `weather_alert_preferences_screen`, `sms_notification_preferences_screen`). No new screens were created, but all existing ones were updated with a new component instance.
*   **Component Instances Used/Created:**
    *   `LayoutManager` (newly created component type, and an instance of it was added to every existing screen).
*   **Sub-Agent Capabilities Discovered:** No new sub-agent capabilities were discovered during this process. All operations used existing capabilities.

**Rationale:**

The `LayoutManager` component type was introduced to explicitly represent the application's ability to adapt its UI layout to different device orientations. By adding an instance of this component to every screen, we ensure that all parts of the application are capable of handling this system-level behavior. The `orientation_modes` and `responsive_props` on the `LayoutManager` instance provide a clear mechanism for defining how each screen's layout should change based on the device's orientation. This approach centralizes the responsiveness logic, making the design more robust and maintainable.
